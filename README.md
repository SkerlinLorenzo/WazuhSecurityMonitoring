# Wazuh Security Monitoring in the Home Lab

### Project Overview

<p> 
Welcome to the Wazuh Security Monitoring Projectâ€”a personal expedition into the dynamic landscape of security information and event management (SIEM). This project is more than just a technical showcase; it's a narrative that unfolds in the home lab, leveraging the power of Wazuh to orchestrate real-time threat detection, meticulous log analysis, and centralized monitoring.

The Wazuh SIEM system was deployed on an Ubuntu server hosted on Linode. Leveraging the robust infrastructure provided by Linode ensured a reliable and scalable foundation for the security monitoring solution.

### Key Features

* Multi-Platform Monitoring: The Wazuh system is actively monitoring a diverse set of devices and operating systems, including a MAC laptop, a Windows laptop, a Kali Linux virtual machine, and an Ubuntu virtual machine. This showcases the versatility of Wazuh in handling a variety of environments.

* Agent Deployment: Various Wazuh agents were successfully deployed on the monitored devices, establishing a secure communication channel between the endpoints and the centralized Wazuh server. This allows for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of security events.

* Real-Time Threat Detection: Wazuh's intrusion detection capabilities are actively identifying and alerting on potential security threats across the monitored devices. This enhances the overall security posture by providing real-time insights into suspicious activities.

* Vulnerability Management: Elevating the project's capabilities, Wazuh now extends its reach into vulnerability management. It conducts regular assessments on the monitored devices, identifying potential weaknesses and providing insights for proactive security measures.
